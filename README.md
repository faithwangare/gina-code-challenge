2.Speed Detector - A program that takes as input the speed of a car and gives the driver one demerit point for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70). If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".
3.Net Salary Calculator - A program that calculates the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary of an employee given their basic salary and benefits.
