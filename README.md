This repository contains solutions to three problems: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator.

1.Student Grade Generator
This program prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100, and then outputs the corresponding grade according to the following scale:

A: 80-100
B: 60-79
C: 50-59
D: 40-49
E: less than 40

2.SPEED DETECTOR
This program takes as input the speed of a car, and then prints the number of demerit points incurred by the driver according to the following scale:

Ok: speed is less than 70 km/h
1 point: speed is between 71 and 75 km/h
2 points: speed is between 76 and 80 km/h
3 points: speed is between 81 and 85 km/h
... and so on, adding one point for every 5 km/h above the speed limit
If the driver incurs more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".


3.NET SALARY CALCULATOR
This program calculates the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions, and net salary of an employee given their basic salary and benefits. The tax rates are obtained from the KRA and NHIF websites as linked in the problem statement.

Conclusion
These toy problems are simple exercises designed to test basic programming skills.
